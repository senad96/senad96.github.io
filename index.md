## About Me

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science with honors with a focus on deep learning and computer vision at **Sapienza University of Rome**. Through my academic studies and research work as a research assistant, I have developed extensive knowledge in **Machine Learning**, particularly in adversarial deep learning and generative modeling on the image domain.
I am passionate about taking on new challenges and exploring emerging technologies. I am constantly expanding my skill set and keeping up-to-date with the latest developments, including **MLOps**, **Generative AI**, and **NLP applications**.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** adversarial robustness, generative AI, trustworthy ML
- **Computer Vision:** image generation, reppresentation learning


## News
